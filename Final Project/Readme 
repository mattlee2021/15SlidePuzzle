To compile this program, use javac *.java
To run the program, type java SlidePuzzle

The program works by clicking on the desired tile in order to move the empty tile.
The goal of the puzzle is to order the tiles from one to fifteen, with the empty tile in the bottom right corner.
If you get stuck, you can click the hint button and a hint may appear in the console.
Note that since there are so many possible ways of solving the puzzle, if you click the hint button before you have only 4 or so tiles left to put into place, 
you will not get a hint. Instead, the program will print in the console that you should keep trying to solve the puzzle because the breadth first search 
takes a long time to run since there are many possible moves to finish the puzzle.

If you wish to stop playing, you can exit the window by clicking the X in the upper right corner.
If you solve the puzzle, you will get a congratulations message, and a message on the screen telling you how many moves it took you to complete the puzzle.
Once you see this message, you can click anywhere on the window to play again, and the puzzle will automatically reset to a new random configuration.
When this happens, your number of moves also resets to zero.

We hope you enjoy our game!
